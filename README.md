Project Description: Risk Prediction for Metaverse Transactions Based on Specific Attributes
This project explores various machine learning techniques to assess and predict the risk level of transactions in the Metaverse, leveraging specific attributes. The methodology includes data preprocessing, feature engineering, and the application of multiple classification algorithms.

1️⃣ Descriptive Data Analysis

Initial data exploration, including data description, summary statistics, and correlation matrix to understand the relationships between attributes.
2️⃣ Fuzzy Clustering

Implementation of fuzzy clustering techniques to segment data points based on their risk level, allowing for better insights into risk groupings.
3️⃣ Logistic Regression Models

Binary logistic regression is used to classify transactions into risky vs. non-risky categories.
Multinomial logistic regression extends the classification into multiple risk levels.
4️⃣ Decision Trees & Classification Models

Regression trees predict the likelihood of a transaction being high-risk.
Classification trees categorize transactions into predefined risk classes.
The pruning process ensures optimal model performance by eliminating unnecessary branches.
5️⃣ K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) Classification

A distance-based approach to predict the risk category of new transactions based on similarities with historical data.
6️⃣ Neural Networks for Classification

Implementation of artificial neural networks (ANNs) to detect complex patterns in transaction risk prediction, enhancing accuracy through deep learning techniques.
Outcome & Significance
This project provides a comprehensive analysis of risk prediction in Metaverse transactions using multiple machine learning algorithms. The comparative evaluation of logistic regression, decision trees, KNN, and neural networks offers insights into the most effective methods for identifying fraudulent or high-risk transactions.
